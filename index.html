            <h1>My target on</h1>
            <h1 class="light-blue">Mission 2022</h1>
            <p>In this new year i made a promice to myself. And that is i am going to give my best effort to become a
                web
                developer
                in 2022. Perviously i have made similar kind of target but after some week's or month later i found
                myself
                lost.
                So this year i took it to the next level as i got myself admitted in one of the best platform
                Programming
                Hero
                to keep me under pressure and on track so that i dont get lost after few weeks or month. Let's hope for
                the
                best
                and keep practicing hard</p>
