            <p>In this new year i made a promice to myself. And that is i am going to give my best effort to become a
                web
                developer
                in 2022. Perviously i have made similar kind of target but after some week's or month later i found
                myself
                lost.
                So this year i took it to the next level as i got myself admitted in one of the best platform
                Programming
                Hero
                to keep me under pressure and on track so that i dont get lost after few weeks or month. Let's hope for
                the
                best
                and keep practicing hard</p>

                Development is a journey. And in this journey we need to stay strong and keep up with the world.
                Otherwise we will be left behind. So we need to keep developing us no matter what happens.

            <p>
                As I am from Bangladesh we need to know what's happening with the outside world also. Because in this
                time we are not only bounded by our country to work. We can work or explore anywhere in the world. And
                community plays a key role in that. The more we will be close to our community the more fun we will have
                while developing ourselves.
